    <h2>Basic Functionality</h2>

    <p>
        Package Control is driven by the Command Palette. To open the palette,
        press <kbd>ctrl<em>+</em>shift<em>+</em>p</kbd> (Win, Linux) or
        <kbd>cmd<em>+</em>shift<em>+</em>p</kbd>
        (macOS). All Package Control commands begin with <tt>Package
        Control:</tt>, so start by typing <kbd>Package</kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The command palette will now show a number of commands. Most users
        will be interested in the following:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Install Package</dt>
        <dd>
            Show a list of all available packages that are available for install.
            This will include all of the packages from the <a href="/browse">default channel</a>, plus
            any from repositories you have added.
        </dd>
        <dt>Add Repository</dt>
        <dd>
            Add a repository that is not included in the default channel.
            <em>This allows users to install and automatically update
            packages from GitHub and BitBucket.</em> To add a package
            hosted on GitHub, enter the URL in the form
            <tt>https://github.com/username/repo</tt>. Don’t include
            <tt>.git</tt> at the end! BitBucket repositories should use the
            format <tt>https://bitbucket.org/username/repository</tt>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Remove Package</dt>
        <dd>
            This removes the package folder, and the package name from the
            <tt>installed_packages</tt> list in
            <tt>Packages/User/Package Control.sublime-settings</tt>. The
            <tt>installed_packages</tt> list allow Package Control to automatically
            install packages for you if you copy your <tt>Packages/User/</tt>
            folder to another machine.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        By default Package Control checks for new versions on startup. This
        setting, plus the list of channels and repositories are managed through
        the <a href="/docs/settings">Settings</a>.

    <h2>
        Other Commands
    </h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Add Channel</dt>
        <dd>
            Adds another channel that lists repositories. This is uncommon,
            but allows users to create a custom channel of repositories to share.
        </dd>
        <dt>Create Package File</dt>
        <dd>
            For package developers. Takes a package folder and generates a
            <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file that can be uploaded onto the web and
            referenced in the <tt>packages.json</tt> file for a repository.
        </dd>
        <dt>Create Binary Package File</dt>
        <dd>
            For package developers. Creates a <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file that does not include
            the source <tt>.py</tt> files, but instead the <tt>.pyc</tt> bytecode
            files. This is useful to distribute commercial packages. Be sure
            to check the resulting <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file to ensure that
            at least one <tt>.py</tt> file is included so that Sublime Text will
            load the package.
        </dd>
        <dt>Disable Package</dt>
        <dd>
            Disables a package, which causes any Python scripts to be unloaded,
            and other files such as <tt>.sublime-keymap</tt> files to be
            unloaded also.
        </dd>
        <dt>Discover Packages</dt>
        <dd>
            Opens up a web browser to <a href="/browse">Browse</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Enable Package</dt>
        <dd>
            Re-enables a package that has been disabled.
        </dd>
        <dt>Upgrade/Overwrite All Packages</dt>
        <dd>
            This will upgrade <strong>ALL</strong> packages, including ones
            that were not installed via Package Control. If you are developing
            a custom copy of a package, you may not want to use this command.
        </dd>
        <dt>Upgrade Package</dt>
        <dd>
            Show a list of packages that are available for upgrade and let the
            user pick which they would like to update.
        </dd>
        <dt>Install Local Dependency</dt>
        <dd>
            Show a quick panel of folders in the <tt>Packages/</tt> that are not
            currently installed as dependencies, but have a
            <tt>.sublime-dependency</tt> file. Once a dependency is selected, a
            loader will be installed, allowing the dependency to be used for
            development, without having to submit it to the default channel
            first.
        </dd>
        <dt>Package Control Settings – Default</dt>
        <dd>
            Open the default settings file, which can be used as a reference
            for changing the User settings. <em>Any changes to this file will
            be lost whenever Package Control is automatically or manually
            upgraded.</em>
        </dd>
        <dt>Package Control Settings – User</dt>
        <dd>
            Opens the user’s settings for Package Control. Any settings changes
            should be saved here so they are not overwritten when a new version
            of Package Control is released.
        </dd>
