<h1>Customizing Packages</h1>

<p>
	There will frequently be situations where a package works <em>almost</em>
	exactly how you want it to, however, a few small tweaks would make it
	perfect. Depending on what version of Sublime Text you are using and
	how the package is installed, you have a few different options for
	customizing a package.
</p>

<h2>Packed vs. Unpacked</h2>

<p>
	Sublime Text 3 offers the most options for overriding a package. By default,
	packages will be installed by placing a <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file
	in the <tt>Installed Packages/</tt> folder. Then users may override individual
	files in the package by creating a folder <tt>Packages/{Package Name}/</tt>
	and placing edited files in there.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately not all packages work when stored inside of a 
	<tt>.sublime-package</tt> file. This is usually because the package includes
	files such as shared libraries or executables. If a developer places a file
	named <tt>.no-sublime-package</tt> in the root of their package, Package
	Control will extract the package into <tt>Packages/{Package Name}/</tt>.
</p>
<p>
	Packages stored in <tt>.sublime-package</tt> files are referred to as
	<em>packed</em>, whereas packages extracted into a folder in
	<tt>Packages/</tt> are referred to as <em>unpacked</em>. Sublime Text 2
	only supports unpacked packages.
</p>
<p>
	Unpacked packages can be customized via
	<a href="#User_Package">User Package</a> or
	<a href="#Git-Hg_Clone">Git/Hg Clone</a>. Packed packages may use
	<a href="#Overrides">Overrides</a>, <a href="#User_Package">User Package</a>
	or <a href="#Git-Hg_Clone">Git/Hg Clone</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="Editing_Unpacked_Files">Editing Unpacked Files</h2>

<p>
	Editing an unpacked package’s files is not a good idea unless you’ve cloned
	the package via Git/Hg. This is because, by default, Package Control will
	automatically upgrade packages to the newest version. This will cause any
	edits to files to be overwritten. If you experience this, you may
	wish to check out the <a href="#Backups">Backups</a> section to learn how
	to recover your customized version of a file.
</p>

<h2 id="User_Package">User Package</h2>

<p>
	The <tt>Packages/User/</tt> folder is the <tt>User</tt> package. It is
	unique in that it is loaded <em>last</em> by Sublime Text. This allows
	users to place changes to <tt>.sublime-settings</tt> and
	<tt>.sublime-keymap</tt> files in this folder.
</p>
<p>
	Sublime Text loads these files by name. Thus if a package has a file named
	<tt>Package Control.sublime-settings</tt> in the package, a file with the
	same name in the <tt>User</tt> package will override any of the settings
	in the original file. The same is true for key bindings.
</p>

<h2 id="Overrides">Overrides</h2>

<p>
	If a package for Sublime Text 3 is installed as a packed package, it should
	be possible to directly override individual non-python files. To do this,
	create a <tt>Packages/{Package Name}/</tt> folder and save customized
	versions of the files with the same name they are in the
	<tt>.sublime-package</tt> file.
</p>
<p>
	To view the original files, you can view the repository online for
	packages from GitHub or BitBucket, or use a zip program to unpack the
	<tt>.sublime-package</tt> file.
</p>

<h2 id="Git-Hg_Clone">Git/Hg Clone</h2>

<p>
	For complete customization of a package, it will likely be necessary to
	use a version control program, such as Git or Hg, to clone a copy of
	the original package repository into the <tt>Packages/</tt> folder.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to make customizations would be to fork the original repository
	and clone your fork of it. If you think your customizations could be useful
	to others, consider sending a pull request to have your changes merged into
	the original version.
</p>

<p>
	If you’ve cloned it from your own fork of the
	repository, no settings need to be changed. If you clone it from the
	original repository, you will likely want to set the
	<a href="/docs/settings#setting-ignore_vcs_packages">ignore_vcs_packages</a>
	setting.
</p>

<p>
	There are a number of settings that control how packages are upgraded if
	you have cloned a repository and not set <tt>ignore_vcs_packages</tt> to
	<tt>false</tt>. These include:
	<a href="/docs/settings#setting-git_binary">git_binary</a>,
	<a href="/docs/settings#setting-git_update_command">git_update_command</a>,
	<a href="/docs/settings#setting-hg_binary">hg_binary</a>,
	<a href="/docs/settings#setting-hg_update_command">hg_update_command</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="Backups">Backups</h2>

<p>
	If you do ever find yourself in a situation where your edits to a
	package were overwritten by Package Control, you can find a backup
	copy in the <em>Backup/</em> folder. This folder can be located by
	selecting the <em>Preferences &gt; Browse Packages…</em> menu and
	then browsing up a folder. Backups are stored in timestamped folders.
