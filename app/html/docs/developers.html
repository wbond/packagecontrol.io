<h2>Submitting a New Package</h2>

<p>
    One of the biggest reasons developers love Sublime Text is because of the
    package ecosystem that has developed. Package Control not only helps to
    make installing packages easier, but also has the goal of indexing all
    of the available pacakges.
</p>

<p>
    If you’ve taken the time to develop a package, please consider added it to
    the default Package Control channel so users can easily install and keep
    your package up-to-date.
</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol class="submit_package">
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Host your plugin in its own repository on GitHub or BitBucket.</strong><br />
			Only include a single plugin, and have the plugin files in the root of
			the repo.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Do not include <tt>package-metadata.json</tt> in your
			repository.</strong><br >
			This file is created on each client machine to track what version of a package is installed. To customize the description of your package, do so using the description field on GitHub or
			BitBucket. Versioning will be controlled by creating tags in Git
			or Hg.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel">Package Control Channel</a></strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<strong>Add your package info to the appropriate JSON file
			in the <em>repository/</em> folder.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Please make sure you keep the packages in alphabetical order.</p>
		<p>
			Your addition should look like the following, just with your own
			user and repository names:
		</p>
		<pre>{
	"name": "Alignment",
	"details": "https://github.com/wbond/sublime_alignment",
	"releases": [
		{
			"details": "https://github.com/wbond/sublime_alignment/tags"
		}
	]
}</pre>
		<p>
			A new version of your package will be released whenever you create
			a new tag in the form <tt>#.#.#</tt>, e.g. <tt>1.3.9</tt>. See
			<a href="http://semver.org">SemVer.org</a> for full details on valid version numbers.
		</p>
		<p>
			For full documentation of all available options, please see the
			<a href="https://raw.github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/master/example-repository.json">example-repository.json</a> file.
		</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p id="Remove_Sublime">
			<strong>If your package contains the word <em>Sublime</em>
			in it, consider using the <tt>"name"</tt> field to remove <em>Sublime</em> for the sake of reducing noise.</strong><br>
			Having a giant list of packages for Sublime Text that all use
			<tt>Sublime</tt> in their name gets annoying.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li id="Run_Tests">
		<p>
			<strong>Run the tests.</strong><br>
			If you have python installed you should try to run the tests to make sure your change doesn't break the build. From the root of the repository run: <tt>python -m unittest</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>On a Mac:</em> make sure you are using Python 3 for this (<tt>python --version</tt>). If you have the python3 package from HomeBrew installed you should run: <tt>python3 -m unittest</tt>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Send a pull request</strong>
	</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="Channels_and_Repositories">Channels and Repositories</h2>

<p>
	Channels are JSON files hosted on a URL that contains a list of
	repository URLs. See <a href="https://raw.github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/master/example-channel.json">example-channel.json</a> for the format. When a user
	requests to install a package, their channels are queried for a list of
	repositories.
</p>
<p>
	By default, a single channel is included with
	Package Control, <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/channel.json">https://sublime.wbond.net/channel.json</a>.
	The only reason to create another channel is if you want to create
	a private distribution for a closed group of people.
</p>

<p>
	Repositories are JSON files hosted on a URL that contain a list of packages.
	See <a href="https://raw.github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/master/example-repository.json">example-repository.json</a> for the format. The
	JSON structure allows for
	specifying platforms (windows, osx, linux), compatible versions of Sublime
	Text, labels, URLs and more.
</p>

<h2 id="Editing_Packages">Editing Packages</h2>

<p>
	Please be aware that by default, Package Control will automatically
	upgrade all packages every time the editor is started. If you are
	editing a package that anyone other than yourself is committing to, you
	should use Git or Hg to initially clone the repository instead of
	using the <em>Install Package</em> command.
</p>

<p>
	If you clone a repository, Package Control will use the VCS to
	pull down and merge updates, insteading of overwriting your edits with
	the latest version. The exact commands that are used to pull down
	and merge changes can be configured via the settings.
</p>

<h3>Backups</h3>

<p>
	If you do ever find yourself in a situation where your edits to a
	package were overwritten by Package Control, you can find a backup
	copy in the <em>Backup</em> folder. This folder can be located by
	selecting the <em>Preferences &gt; Browse Packages…</em> menu and
	then browsing up a folder. Backups are stored in timestamped folders.
</p>

<h2 id="Installation_and_Upgrade_Messages">Installation and Upgrade Messages</h2>

<p>
	When creating a package, it is possible to show users a message when
	the package is installed, and also after upgrades. To do this a
	file named <em>messages.json</em> must be included in the root
	directory of the package. The <em><a href="https://raw.github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/master/example-messages.json">example-messages.json</a></em> file shows
	the proper structure of the json. Each value will be a file path that
	is relative to the package directory. Each key will either be the
	string <em>install</em> or a version number.
</p>

<p>
	When a package is installed, if the key <em>install</em> is present
	in the <em>messages.json</em> file, the value will be used as the
	file path to a txt file containing a message to display the users.
</p>

<p>
	When a package is upgraded, Package Control looks through each key
	in the <em>messages.json</em> file and shows the content of the
	text file that is a value of any key that is higher than the previous
	version of the package the user has installed. Thus if the user
	had version <em>1.1.0</em> installed, the txt files for <em>1.2.0</em>
	and <em>1.1.1</em> would be shown. If the user had version
	<em>1.1.1</em> installed, only the messages for version <em>1.2.0</em>
	would be shown.
</p>

<h2 id="Creating_a_Package_File">Creating a Package File</h2>

<p>
	If you are developing a package, and plan on doing custom repository
	hosting instead of using GitHub or BitBucket, Package Control includes
	a command to
	create a <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file for you from one of your package
	directories.
</p>
<p>
	Run the <em>Create Package</em> command and you can select what
	package you would like to create a package file for. The packager
	exlcudes various VCS metadata, Sublime Text cache files and
	<tt>.pyc</tt> files by default. The list
	of excluded files can be tweaking through the settings.
</p>
