<h1>Say Thanks</h1>

<section class="first">
    <p>
        Package Control is completely free to use, the code is
        <a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control">open source</a>,
        and I provide hosting for the
        <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json">default channel</a>
        and this website. Donations from users help pay bills and
        allow me dedicate time to the continued development and support of this
        project.
    </p>

    <p class="thanks">
        However, money is not the only way to support the project. If youâ€˜ve
        found Package Control useful, feel free to send me
        <a href="https://twitter.com/wbond">a tweet</a> or
        a <a href="https://github.com/wbond/package_control">a star</a>.

    <h2>Donate</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Recurring monthly donations, of even small amounts, are extremely
        appreciated!</strong> A recurring donation of $2.50 puts over $2 in my pocket
        (after fees). With hundreds of thousands of daily users, I am hopeful
        that users will be so generous as to give the equivalent of a
        coffee or beer each month.

        <em>Finally, I want to say a huge thank you for all of the previous
        donations I have received! Over the past four years, I have received
        close to $8,000 that have gone towards server costs, a Mac for
        cross-platform testing and a healthy supply of caffiene for myself and
        my family.</em>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
        Currently I am seeking support from the community via recurring
        and one time donations, plus relevant affiliate opportunities. If you
        have a product that you think Package Control users may benefit from,
        please <a href="mailto:will@wbond.net">email me</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        A couple of times in the history of the project I have solicited
        donations. These go to cover the costs related to the server and my
        own time in supporting the project, since I am self-employed. For a
        while I also worked with an ad network to help provide some income from
        the project. While it was open to individuals, I also accepted
        donations via Gittip/Gratipay.
    </p>
    <p>
        I made the decision to remove ads when I started getting pressured to
        prioritize ads, with the final straw being an unexpected 50% cut in rate.
        Gratipay pivoted to team-based projects, and the last thing I need is
        adminitrative work managing a team of people across the globe.
